/**
 * Like a LiveExpression but ensures that its refresh method is always called
 * in a background job.
 * <p>
 * With a regular LiveExp the refresh will be called on the same thread
 * as the change event it reacts to. So in general you have little control
 * over what thread that might be.
 * <p>
 * {@link AsyncLiveExpression} is when the 'compute' method called during refresh
 * does something that you might not want to just execute, for example, on the UI thread.
 * <p>
 * It is also useful in that when refreshes might be 'lengthy' operations, bursty events
 * triggering refreshes will only causes limited refreshes as only a single Job is
 * being scheduled and rescheduled.
