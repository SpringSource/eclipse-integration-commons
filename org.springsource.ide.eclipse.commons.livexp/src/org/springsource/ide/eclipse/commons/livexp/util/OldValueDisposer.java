/**
 * Wrapper around a LiveVariable. Tracks the live variable's value
 * and, whenever the value is changed, calls 'dispose' on the previous value.
 * <p>
 * It also ensures that 'dispose' is called on the final value if the LiveExp
 * itself is disposed.
 * <p>
 * Note: The LiveExp framework's design as grown over time unfortunately doesn't
 * currently provide a strong guarantee that *all* values will be seen by a listener.
 * <p>
 * So, some care should be taken with the wrapped live expression. It should *only* really be
 * applied to a type of LiveExp that calls its value listeners synchronously (i.e.
 * listener is called immediately when the value changed.
 * <p>
 * Even for synchronous listener calls some strange effects may occur if the synchronous
 * value change propagations contain cycles.
 * <p>
 * A proper solution to this problem would likely entail a big change / rethinking of
 * how livexps work and dispatch events.
 * <p>
 * In the mean time, this class can be used safely to track the value of a simple
 * LiveVariable and dispose its old value whenever a new value is assigned.
 * <p>
 * As of STS 4.5.2 the OldValueDisposer because of these limitations, it is now tightly
 * coupled to a LiveVarable instance that it creates itself. This automatically ensures
 * that it is only ever used with a type of LiveExperssion that doesn't cause problems
 * for its implementation.
